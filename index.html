    <h1>Megamind Is An Underrated Film</h1>
    <p>Despicable Me did not deserve all those sequels.</p>
    <h2>Do you like <i>30 Rock</i>?</h2>
    <p>Tina Fey, who plays the female lead in Megamind, asked her writers to punch up the script during developement!</p>
    <h2>Do you like Obama?</h2>
    <p>It's his favorite movie! * </p>
    <h2>Do you like SPIKES?</h2>
    <p>There are so many!  They are on everything! They are so unnecessary!</p>
    <h2>Do you like Academy Awards?</h2>
    <p>Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill are in this movie, and, boy howdy, they bring that talent with them!</p>
    <br />
    <p>* I have no evidence to back this up, but there is a parody of the Shepard Ferry "Hope" poster in there somewhere.</p>
